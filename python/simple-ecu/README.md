# Simple ecu
Simple_ecu folder contains **ecu.py**. With intention to give example and inspiration to further development. To get started and to get more details of the examples, continue reading.

Simple ecu simulates 2 ecu:s which are connected (using `LIN`/`CAN`/`udp`) (defaults to `upd`)
> If you use `CAN` devices you need to connect the connectors, creating you own simple network (remember to terminated the ends).

`Ecu_A`:
- Publishes `counter` signal on a timer.  
- Synchronously reads `counter_times_2` and prints the results.

`Ecu_B`:
- Subscribes to `counter`
- Doubles the value and publishes `counter_times_2` 
> Ecu_B also showcases a syncronous read using a timer.

## Pre-requisites

> Have knowledge of the ip address to your beamy broker installation, if you have the web-client running you can get the ip in the bottom left corner.

## Get started

From *this* location run:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> if you don't have python3 installed go [here](https://github.com/beamylabs/beamylabs-start/tree/master/examples/grpc/python#readme)

### Options

ecu.py can be started with options `-h` or `--ecu <address>`.

* `--url <address>` - Points to the ip of your beamy broker installation, if this option is not used the scripts will use address `http://127.0.0.1:50051`. For example start the script by typing:
`python3 ecu.py --url http://192.168.0.xxx`

* `-h` - Help, shows available options for script, run `python3 ecu.py -h`

### Default instructions
1. Run shell (terminal, powershell, etc.).
2. From [this directory](.) run:

```sh
python ecu.py --url <address>
```

### Overview
A bunch of things are going on in this examples and it all starts in the main function `def run(argv):`. Lets break it down.

#### Setting up stubs and configuration
First we start of with setting up a connection to the beamy broker (with the ip that was passed to the script) and then defining the gRPC stubs that will be used. In code it typically looks like this:

```python
intercept_channel = helper.create_channel(url, x_api_key)
network_stub = broker.network_api_pb2_grpc.NetworkServiceStub(intercept_channel)
system_stub = broker.system_api_pb2_grpc.SystemServiceStub(intercept_channel)
helper.check_license(system_stub)
```

#### Configuration
Simple ecu folder contains some examples of different configurations, available configurations to use are the following:

* [configuration_can](https://github.com/beamylabs/beamylabs-start/tree/master/examples/grpc/python/simple_ecu/configuration_can)
* [configuration_lin](https://github.com/beamylabs/beamylabs-start/tree/master/examples/grpc/python/simple_ecu/configuration_lin)
* [configuration_udp](https://github.com/beamylabs/beamylabs-start/tree/master/examples/grpc/python/simple_ecu/configuration_udp)

The example scripts uploads and reloads configuration with the `system_stub` that was defined above. Some lines are commented and not in use, but you can easily uncomment a line to shift between configurations or feel free to use your own.
It will look similar to this:
```
upload_folder(system_stub, "configuration_udp")
# upload_folder(system_stub, "configuration_lin")
# upload_folder(system_stub, "configuration_can")
# upload_folder(system_stub, "configuration_canfd")
reload_configuration(system_stub)
```
> For _CAN_/_LIN_ to work you need seperate HW.
#### Threads
The last part of `ecu.py` is starting up threads, you can read the docs for threading [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.html). 
You will see a thread called `ecu_A_thread`, this thread defines the target-function `ecu_A` and will then start the thread. 
```python
ecu_A_thread = Thread(
  target=ecu_A,
  args=(
    network_stub,
    1,
  ),
)
ecu_A_thread.start()
```
The function `ecu_A` will publish one or multiple signals which then can be caught and read by ecu_B. In this examples `ecu_A` also reads a value that's been published by ecu_B.

We also see a thread called `ecu_B_sub_thread` which shows how to subscribe to signals that has been published by ecu_A. The thread `ecu_read_on_timer` is a synchronous variant of this and also has the purpose to read.

`ecu_B_sub_thread` thread uses `act_on_signal` which will invoke provided function (here a lambda) once a subscrpition is triggered on any of the provided signals.

```python
for subs_counter in subscripton:
    fun(subs_counter.signal)
```

```python
ecu_B_sub_thread = Thread(
    target=act_on_signal,
    args=(
        ecu_b_client_id,
        network_stub,
        [
            signal_creator.signal("counter", "ecu_B"),
        ],
        True,  # only report when signal changes
        lambda signals: double_and_publish(
            network_stub,
            ecu_b_client_id,
            signal_creator.signal("counter", "ecu_B"),
            signals,
        ),
    ),
)
```

Every time the `counter` signal comes, the function will take the value from the incoming signal, double the value and publish it as another signal `counter_times_2` (which then can be read by ecu_A). I will look like this:

```python
def double_and_publish(network_stub, client_id, trigger, signals):
    for signal in signals:
        print(f"ecu_B, (subscribe) {signal.id.name} {get_value(signal)}")
        if signal.id == trigger:
            publish_signals(
                client_id,
                network_stub,
                [
                    signal_creator.signal_with_payload(
                        "counter_times_2", "ecu_B", ("integer", get_value(signal) * 2)
                    ),
                ],
            )
```
